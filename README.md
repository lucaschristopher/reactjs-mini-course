***Rocketseat's starter mini-course** is a kick-start for the ReactJS universe. In it, we learned concepts related to ReactJS and the creation of a mini system simulating the [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/) functionality. As well as project structuring, we also see components create, connection to REST API, pagination and so on.*
